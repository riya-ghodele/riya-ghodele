## My learning roadmap
- Foundations
  - HTML & CSS — structure and layout
  - JavaScript basics — variables, loops, functions
  - Git & GitHub — version control and sharing work
- Practice & Projects
  - Build simple projects and iterate (personal site, small apps)
  - Read code from other beginners and try to add features
- Soft skills
  - Practice explaining what you built (write short READMEs)
  - Join or form study groups and do peer code reviews
  - Time management: set small weekly goals and reflect
- Problem solving
  - Start with easy challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) (easy)
  - Use [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) for learning web basics

## Beginner-friendly project ideas
- Personal website / portfolio — introduce yourself and link projects
- To-do list app — practice DOM, state, and local storage
- Quiz app — practice data structures (arrays/objects) and logic
- Simple calculator or timer — practice functions and UI
- Note: For each project, write a short README describing what you learned

## Tools & tech I'm starting with
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript (ES6 basics)
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- (Later) Node.js or Python
